# Mirrored Interactions


## **Context**

A group that meets regularly and hopes to gain more awareness about their interactions.


## **Strengths**

The interactions of a group clearly show how people behave when faced with different Tensions. In these meetings, which may be the Circle Meetings proposed by O2 or other more informal interactions, anti-patterns such as Everything is for Everyone can manifest. If an individual has a preference for systematically waiting for everyone's approval before taking action, the observant change agent can clearly watch this film unfold. These are opportunities that can be explored to help the Circle or team to become aware of these interactions, which are often not identified, and therefore never adapted.


## **Problem**

We need to be clear about the interactions and mechanisms that people are using to address their Tensions, looking beyond the context of a conversation and / or discussion.


## **Solution**

During Synchronize Mode or any meeting where the group is seeking to resolve or address an important issue, the Facilitator can pause the conversations and offer a summary of what has been observed. This can happen after each Tension processed (in Synchronize Mode) or at the time the Facilitator deems it convenient. If paraphrasing interactions, the Facilitator can highlight things like:



1. Who made a request or posed the question
2. What kind of request was made (clarification, project, action, doubt, sharing)
3. Who spoke and who did not speak
4. Who looked or who didn't
5. Who was consulted or gave and opinion and who did not
6. What did Secretary do with the request made

After sharing the observations, the Facilitator can also promote a reflection on the quality of the interaction, asking questions:

How do you assess the quality of this interaction?

Does this interaction represent the new distributed / self-managed power structure, or does it contain shadows from the old structure?

Application Example

Imagine that a Facilitator is participating in a Circle Meeting with four people. Kelly (External Link and former team manager), Robert (a new person in the circle and Secretary), Eloa (less experienced member) and Yuri (more experienced member, and former coordinator).

During Synchronize Mode, Eloa brings up a Tension related to a responsibility for a Role she fills, called Instagram Master.

Eloá: I would like to share a strategy that I'm using on Instagram and also to know your opinion about it. Since last week I have reduced the number of posts per week, because I realized that the engagement is the same [...]. I was wondering how you guys see it.

Robert: If you have already tried the experiment and have these results, I don't see any reason to do it differently.

Kelly: I don't think it makes sense because we need to keep our users with content. It's not just a matter of metrics [...].

Eloá: I understand Kelly, but we could also focus our energy on other, more important things [...].

[The conversation continues for a few more minutes].

In the end Eloá says that she is satisfied.

The Facilitator observes carefully and decides to use "Mirrored Interactions", sharing what he observed:

Eloá brought a strategy that she is looking to follow in the role she plays as Instagram Master.

Eloá says he is following strategy A (post less), but still asks the group's opinion about it.

Robert and Kelly shared their opinion. The rest remained silent.

Kelly seems to see some harm in the path described by Eloa and invested some time arguing that path B (to post more) is better. Kelly seems unhappy with the option suggested by Eloa (this is an inference) and the conversation goes on.

Eloa says he is satisfied, but her face shows otherwise (inference).

The Secretary does not record any next actions from the conversation.

The Facilitator then makes room for participants to talk about the mirror given and offer different views, especially inferences. Eloa confirms that she was a little uncomfortable with the conversation. Kelly also assumes that she was trying to convince Eloa to follow path B. Following, the group talks about their interaction and reaches the following conclusions:

Eloa realizes that although she already has a path in her head (strategy A), she tries to please Kelly and include her perspective, even though she has autonomy / authority in her Instagram Master Role.

Kelly acknowledges that she used little empathy in her statements and that she insisted on the suggestion even though she knew that the Eloa had the authority to make the decision.

Yuri had an opinion on the subject, but was afraid to share it and polarize the conversation.

Roberto did not notice the subtleties and found everything very calm, probably because he is new and does not know the group yet.


# **Resulting Context **

After repeating the "Mirror of Interactions" pattern, a group gradually gains more awareness about the subtleties amongst each Tension. Conventional power structures appear on the surface, giving everyone the opportunity to think about and adapt behavior.


# **Rationale**

This pattern is inspired by Nonviolent Communication and also by empathic listening practices used in Forum Light, in the Care Mode.


# **Known Uses**

It has already been used in some Brazilian organizations that practice O2.
