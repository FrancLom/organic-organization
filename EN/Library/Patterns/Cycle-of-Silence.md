# **Cycle of Silence (Pinakarri)**

Also known as: Pinakarri


## **Context**

Used in any type of meeting, a strategic planning session or any type of group dynamic that calls for a brief moment of silence.


## **Problem**

With the day to day flow of information and the whirlwind of things that pass through our minds, we lose focus and/or quality of our presence during meetings. Sometimes we are praised for not having our preferences met, for not having control of the situation or simply for not having rested well last night. At other times, we cease to value small moments of collaboration and we need rituals to add meaning to the processes. There are many situations in which a cycle of silence can be used. Here are some examples: People speak simultaneously. The quality of the group interaction is low and a short break is needed to get perspective. We are going to enter another meeting mode or end the meeting and we need a symbolic way to end the process. We want to feel the wisdom that emerges from the evolutionary field and align our purpose. We are designing strategies that have too much theory and participation is not balanced.


## **Strengths**

A traditional check-in might not be sufficient to create an ambiance that favors presence or that offers a break from a difficult or confusing day.


## **Solution**

The cycles of silence are very useful to connect to the purpose of our roles and circles. When starting any meeting mode (in the facilitator's role), you can use a chime or sound that the group recognizes to start and end cycles of silence. This will create a peaceful and conducive atmosphere for cooperation. During the cycle of silence, participants are invited to feel the weight of their body, breathe deeply and position the tongue on the upper palate to reduce internal dialogue. Although similar, the cycle of silence is not a process of deep meditation and it is recommended to last no longer than 1min.

It is a cyclic ritual that can help members of an organization to connect with the purpose of its evolutionary process as human beings, community and planet.


## **Tips for good practice**

Use a bell or something that makes a subtle sound to activate cycles of silence. Do not confuse the cycle of silence with a request for silence. Leave the pattern as something that can be invoked at any time by the group.


## **Contextual Results**

Com uma utilização constante dos ciclos de silêncio os participantes conseguem se manter focados, bem dispostos e serenos.


## **Rationale**

This pattern was inspired by Dragon Dreaming, a collaborative project design methodology. In relation to putting one's tongue on the palate, this is substantiated through the research of Steven Pinker who, in his book Instinct of Language, raises the hypothesis that our tongue moves while we are thinking. This is a phenomenon known as subvocation. Keeping the tongue on the palate helps to stop subvocalization (Internal Thoughts) because the tongue and vocal folds move regardless of whether we speak our ideas out loud. If the tongue does not move, the flow of internal thought becomes a little smoother. Of course, it is not something that will completely silence thoughts. The cycle of silence can help to provide generative communication, open dialogue and clarity in meeting modes.


## **Known Uses**

It has been used in at least 10,000 projects around the world in all types of organizations and communities. It is a well-known facilitation technique and has already been adapted to different methods such as Art of Hosting, Wisdom Council, Work That Reconnects and others.
