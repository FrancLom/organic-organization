# Zegg Forum

**Also known as**: 1 minute Forum or  Thematic Forum

# **Context**

Every group, organization or community needs to have time and space to:

1. Strengthen their purpose
2. Share thoughts, feelings and needs deeply to build empathy and mutual trust
3. Understand individual views and values ​​(what moves each one).

FORUM is a method that can be very useful in building trust and maturity within communities and groups, while strengthening the internal purpose.

Forums can be used for a group to expand understandings or thoughts (about a topic, usually controversial or that involves personal values), creating a space for listening and empathy while avoiding agree vs. disagree conversations or triangulations.

The group sits in a circle and a person goes to the center to speak: the person in the center is the only one that speaks and people in the circle listen in silence.

In the thematic Forum a theme is chosen, it might be a question that is alive in the group, so that each one can bring forward their thoughts about it. It may be about something that has already happened, a check on how work processes are going or something that is intended to be done in the future.

The 1-minute Forum can be used as a check-in - a person states how they are, what feelings are alive in relation to the group.

These two examples above are simpler variations of the Zegg Forum, (but the approach is the same), people are invited to bring what is hot, and it can be a deeper and longer process.  \
A small number of people participate.


# **Strengths**

The Forum's structure allows access to individual thoughts and feelings in a group setting, taking care of aspects of transparency, empathy and vulnerability. It is a space of deep and attentive listening.

The strength of the tool lies in opening a field for controversial issues, conflicts and difficult situations to be raised for the group.

There is a great focus on self-responsibility (about what I bring to the group, about how I present it, and how transparent I am about it), all very beneficial for understanding and practicing autonomy.


# **Problem**

People need space to present how they are feeling in relation to the group, how some themes resonate within and to build a space of trust so that transparency, trust, autonomy and effectiveness happen in a healthy and fluid way.


# **Solution**



* **Fórum Temático**: um tema é proposto pelo Facilitador - uma palavra, uma pergunta - e há o convite para que as pessoas entrem e se expressem a respeito. Não há demarcação de tempo; se o grupo for grande pode-se combinar de ter um aviso após xx min como referência.

Forum is a technology that can be used during Care Mode.

NOTE: It is important to have a Facilitator and a Co-Facilitator (to support and take care of the group when the Facilitator goes into the center).

Propose some agreements for the Forum space:



1. Whoever enters the center speaks in first person. "Whenever I speak, I express how something is for me, my feelings and needs. Even if I quote other people, I am talking about how the situation is lived and experienced by me."
2. Whoever is in the circle, aims to  “suspend judgments” and to listen with empathy to what the other brings; I often perceive my judgments, but I leave them aside to be present for the other who is in the center. What each one says is true and important. At that moment there is only listening, it is important to avoid dialogue and gestures.
3. Facilitator is present but intervenes minimally, taking more care of the aspects of time, clarity of the proposal and remembering the group about the agreements. The Facilitator can support the person at the center, by asking questions to seek clarity and reminding them of  important aspects such as speaking in first person. It is important that the person practises self-responsibility and leaves the center well.
4. Confidentiality of what is treated in the group.

If a person wants to talk to another about a point discussed, it is suggested he do an internal check on what moves him to that conversation and if he will add to whoever brought the point to the center (or he just wants to justify himself, either agree or disagree, give advice etc). If it is something that involves deep feelings or controversial issues, a 24-hour wait is suggested (this is the usual practice), so that there is enough time for the matter to be settled by the person who went to the center.

The facilitator explains the dynamics and makes a ritual introduction to open the space (the space is open to ...):

**Forum of 1 min**: the circle will be open so that each one, if he feels like it, comes in and brings how he is feeling. When 1 minute is up, the Facilitator makes a sound (a light chime, for example) advising that the time is up so that the person is aware and moves to closing thoughts and words.

**Thematic Forum**: a theme is proposed by the Facilitator by way of a word or question - and there is an invitation for people to come in and express themselves about it. There is no time limit however, if the group is large it can be agreed to have a signal after a certain number of minutes as a reference. Zegg Forum: the Zegg Forum itself follows the same structure, but there are no time limits or subject outlines. The center opens up for the person who feels the need to speak or express himself.

This model may require a more structured facilitation, especially if the person has deep feelings and not much practice of expression. It is important to have experienced Facilitators conducting these Forums or, at least, the first practices where more interventions may be needed. The Forum is a time for reflection and to bring perceptions to consciousness and the Facilitator helps to prevent cenarios of victim, victimizer, external ramblings, and etc, entering into the process. NOTE: At the Zegg Forum there is also the option for people in the circle to give "mirrors" - to bring forward speeches, expressions or concerns about what they saw being expressed by the person who went to the center; in this case it is very important that there is already a field of trust and self-responsibility in the group and that people have clarity about what it is like to give a mirror (taking care to see if there was and sort of identification, or if the intention is to give advice, etc.). The Facilitator also facilitates the mirror.

The open forum can take more time, so it is always good to consider the time available and make that clear to the group (to outline the theme or to agree that there may be a need to extend the time, in some cases).


# **Contextual Results**

The practice of the Forum allows people to work on self-knowledge and empathic knowledge of the group. Participants learn to use the space to deal with feelings, while unblocking other issues of the group's work (meetings, agreements, etc.). For some people, the Forum is something liberating and charming and for others, despite recognizing its importance, something that demands effort and openness.

Taking great care to create safe space and checking how people are feeling at the end of the meetings is important. Complementary activities such as empathetic listening in pairs, ranking exercises, judgment dynamics and etc. can (and should be used as a warm-up.


# **Rationale**

This pattern was inspired by the work of Zegg Forum.


# **Known uses**

It has already been used in a diverse number of teams, communities, private and non-profit organizations. It is a practice that has been happening for over 40 years in communities and ecovillages, and is currently being introduced and adapted to other contexts.
