# Tactical Review

**Also known as**: Checklists, Metrics and Project Updates


# **Context**

A group, team or organization that needs to monitor and follow the results of their daily work.  

**Strengths**

Bringing up a wide range of information in a meeting in a short time period is not simple. Many groups invest a lot of time on a few topics and fail to provide an overview that can include looking at quantitative indicators, checking whether recurring activities are being carried out and giving visibility to the multiple actions underway. If everyone only presents what they are doing, people tend to forget a lot of relevant information or spend too much time on minor details.


# **Problem**

For self-organization to be possible, in a group setting, participants need to have visibility into what is happening. The Organic Organization's Review Mode guarantees this, but does not prescribe a format. That's what this pattern is about.


# **Solution**

No ~~Modo Revisar~~ da ~~Reunião de Círculo~~, o ~~Facilitador~~ pode conduzir a revisão de 3 elementos que capturam praticamente todos os tipos de trabalho que um grupo executa: checklists, métricas e projetos

**Checklists**: São perguntas cuja resposta é "Sim" ou "Não" e que buscam dar clareza se uma determinada atividade recorrente aconteceu no período sendo verificado.

In the Circle Meeting Review Mode, the Facilitator can conduct a review of 3 elements that capture virtually all types of work that a group performs: checklists, metrics and projects.

Checklist items: Answered with a "Yes" or "No" in order to seek to clarify whether a particular recurring activity was done during the period being verified.

**Quantitative indicators**: associated with a Role (ideally something that those who energize the Role are able to impact) and gauge the context in which the Circle is inserted.

**Projects**: Initiatives with a beginning, middle and end and that seek to reach a certain result.


## **Examples**

Dado o ~~Papel~~ _Produtor de Conteúdo_ com o ~~Propósito~~ de _Os melhores conteúdos sobre o futuro do trabalho no blog da Target Teal_, poderíamos ter os seguintes checklists, métricas e projetos:

**Checklists**:



* Novos conteúdos criados? (semanal)
* Ofertas de serviços integradas nos novos conteúdos? (semanal)

**Métricas**:



* Número de novos usuários no site (semanal)
* Conteúdos produzidos no mês (mensal)

**Projetos**:



* Guia da Sociocracia publicado
* Novo post sobre organizações evolutivas publicado

Given the Content Producer Role,  with the purpose: Content about the future of work on the Target Teal blog, we could have the following checklists, metrics and projects:

Checklists:

New content created? (weekly)

Service offers integrated into new content? (weekly)

Metrics:

Number of new users on the site (weekly)

Content produced in the month (monthly)

Projects:

Sociocracy Guide published

New post on evolutionary organizations published


## **Construction & Facilitation**

The checklists, metrics and projects for each Role in the Circle must be updated before the Circle Meeting, so that the Facilitator can go through them during the meeting. Facilitation can take the following form:

Checklists: Facilitator reads each checklist item for each Role. Participant answers "Yes" or "No". Quick comments are allowed to justify a "No". Participants cannot ask questions or reactions. In the event of an interruption, the Circle Secretary must register an item on the  List of Tensions for later processing in Synchronize Mode.



Metrics: Facilitator reads the metrics and the responsible participants briefly report on each one. Other participants can ask quick questions for clarification. Any other things should also go to the List of Tensions, as is done with reviewing checklists.

Projects: Facilitator reads each project and asks the responsible participant: "Any updates? The participant responds by reporting what has changed in the project since the last meeting. If there are no updates, the participant should respond - no updates. Quick clarification questions are allowed, other concerns and requests should be treated as Tensions.

Checklists, metrics and initial designs can be changed. New ones can also be created during the meetings. Each change request can be handled with a Tension and processed in Synchronize Mode, or outside of the Circle Meeting. The owner of checklists items, metrics and projects can change them freely, unless a Restriction or Artifact says otherwise.


# **Contextual Results**

Depois de algumas semanas praticando a revisão de checklists, métricas e projetos, os participantes costumam reportar estarem mais bem informados sobre a situação do ~~Círculo~~. Em organizações muito tradicionais, é também comum ouvir pessoas apreciando a possibilidade de prestar contas sobre o seu próprio trabalho, o que antes era normalmente feito pelo antigo antigo líder, chefe ou gestor. A visibilidade das informações também permite que todos tenham acesso às informações necessárias para perceberem novas ~~Tensões~~, descentralizando a coordenação do grupo.

After a few weeks of practicing checklist, metrics and project updates, participants usually report that they are better informed about the Circle's situation. In very traditional organizations, it is also common to hear people enjoying the possibility of being accountable for their own work, which previously was done by the former former leader, boss or manager. The visibility of the information also allows everyone to have access to the information necessary to perceive new Tensions, decentralizing the group's coordination.


# **Rationale**

This pattern is present in the preamble of the Holacracy's Tactical Meeting.

**Known Uses **

This pattern was used in organizations that use Holacracy.
