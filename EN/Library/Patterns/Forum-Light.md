# Forum Light

# **Context**
In a group, team or organization that has little emotional security, where people don't trust each other, difficult conversations do not happen, conflicts are veiled and there are past events that have left remnants of hurt and resentment.


# **Strengths**

Restoring the quality of relationships is essential for a healthy work environment and good performance. However, the most common actions are often escape or disruption, with the possible exclusion of people from the team or organization. This type of solution is often temporary.

**Problem**

People need to go back to believing in each other once again; mutual trust needs to be restored. They need to learn to have difficult conversations and stop avoiding conflict.


# **Solution**

Design a meeting with everyone in the team or circle, it can be a regular (biweekly) meeting to address issues that are alive in the relational field. Propose or build with the group at the first meeting some agreements for this Forum.

Some examples of agreements are:



1. Focus on needs and beware of judgement calls. What each one says is true and important.
2. Speak in first person. "Whenever I speak, I express my feelings and needs and even if I quote someone else, I'm talking about me."
3. You have neither agree nor disagree. We seek connection and have no reason.
4. Las Vegas law. What happens here, stays here. Confidentiality.

With the agreements signed, the facilitator asks who would like to sit in the empty chair in the circle and talk about what is alive or bothering them, that is: sit in the chair and talk about yourself, your feelings, needs and even requests.

Then the facilitator asks: "Would you like someone to paraphrase your speech?" If the person agrees, volunteers sit in the “speaker's chair” and paraphrase what they have heard. At the end, the facilitator asks if the person would like to complement what was “ paraphrased or mirrored”.


# **Contextual Results**

After a few Forum sessions, it is common for the group to feel more confident in their ability to deal with conflicts through the exercise of empathic listening. However, the Forum may lose strength if other agreements aimed at distributing authority are not signed.

In addition, there is a need for a facilitator with some experience in non violent communication to run the process, especially in more difficult situations.


# **Rationale**

This pattern was inspired by Zegg Forum, non-violent communication and the work of Jacob L. Moreno.


# **Known uses**

It has been used in teams of upto 25 people, in private and non-profit organizations.
