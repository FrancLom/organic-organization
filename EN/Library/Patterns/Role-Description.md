# Role Description


# **Also known as**: Reverse To-Do, Initial Structure Description

**Context**

When a [Circle](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#circulos) is forming and needs to describe [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) for the first time. The people involved are those that are already working and usually meet regularly.


# **Forces**

Watch out for pitfalls. Avoid creating extensive [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that do not yet exist. It is important to remember: if people find this process laborious and time-consuming, they will be unwilling to change and adapt the structure.


# **Problem**

We need to create the initial structure in a fast, participatory and elegant way. The focus should be on translating existing work into a structure of [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).


# **Solution**

In a session that can last between 2 to 4 hours, we propose following dynamic to the members of the [circle](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#circulos):

1) Activities performed: Each person writes down everything they have done in the last 30 to 60 days. Only include what was actually done, and not what should have been done but was not for some reason.

Examples of activities:

a) I wrote a post on self-management practices

b) I wrote a post about the importance of self-organization

c) I optimized the blog for search engines

d) I created a new page for Target Teal's online courses

2) Convert into [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis): Each member takes their list and converts the activities into [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis), placing each one on a post-it note. Conversion involves making the activity generic, while observing tips for good [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).

In some cases, two or more activities become one responsibility. All [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) come together in one frame. They are no longer connected to a person and "float" freely.

Conversion Examples:



* Write content for the Target Teal blog (activities a and b)
* Optimize the blog for search engines (activity c)
* Create new pages on the site upon request (activity d)

3) **Clusters** of [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis): The group builds clusters or bundles of [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that have something in common. In general, we use the following criteria to group Responsibilities together: They seem to "go together" or should always be done by the same person. They have a larger common goal (a [Purpose](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis)). In this step, when very similar or the same, [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) are removed.

4) **Roles**: Each cluster of [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) can become a [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis). Participants then identify a name for the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and a [Purpose](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis), observing the tips for [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) names and tips for good [Purposes](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).

5) **Verification**: Participants can try to identify who executes each of the [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis), placing a small sticky note with the names of the people next to the cluster. After that, it is important to verify that each participant who executes the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) does in fact perform all the [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) present. You cannot energize just a part of the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis). If that is the case, it should be considered to divide the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) into other smaller [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).

6) **Artifacts**: Verify if there is an [Artifact](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of exclusive control that is already known and that needs to be registered in any of the [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis). Remember: it is only worth adding [Artifacts](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that are, in fact, someone's exclusive control. You can choose to skip this step and start without any [Artifacts](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).

There, the initial structure is described!

Tips for Good [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis)



1.  An [accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) must begin with an action verb in the gerund form (verb+ing).
2. In general, we leave out [Accountabilities](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) to do with people management, as the objective is to encourage self-management and avoid managing others or monitoring one's development.
3. An [Accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) can name other Roles, but it is not advisable to mention people.
4. Beware of the verbs guarantee, approve, align and collaborate. See the explanation below

**Guarantee**: Using the verb guarantee usually involves an attempt to control a result. We want to know how this is done, rather than the end result. Instead of: "Ensuring that the product is as engaging as possible", we should ask ourselves, how is this done? The answer may be "Developing features that increase user engagement".

**Approve**: In general, when someone uses the verb approve, that person is seeking exclusive control of something. But at O2, an [Accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) never limits another [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis). It usually makes more sense to add an [Artifact](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of the "thing" that is seeking approval in the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that centralizes it. Here's an example: instead of the [Accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) "Approve changes to the Website", add the Artifact "Alterations on Website" to the [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis).

**Align**: The verb to align is very ambiguous and generally does not give the clarity that we seek in [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) descriptions. It can mean: deciding together, communicating something, seeking advice, etc. Using any of the examples above, as they are more objective than aligning.

**Collaborate**: In self-management everyone is free to collaborate with whomever they want. In general, when we explain an [Accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) starting with "collaborating with someone", two things can happen:



1. We can foster the idea that if it is not explicit that someone should collaborate, this Partner does not need to collaborate.
2. When someone needs to "help" another[ Partne](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis)r, he does not take on that [Accountability](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis). Therefore, it is better to clarify in the [role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) description what is needed and make that role accountable for the entire process, and not just "helping".


## **Tips for naming [Roles](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis)**

The name must be simple and memorable. Avoid job names, such as analyst, assistant, manager, director, supervisor, coordinator, etc. Play around with the name, but at the same time make sure that the name gives an idea of ​​what the [role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) does. Examples: Instagram master, Inbound Marketing, Content Producer, etc. The name ends up reflecting the internal culture of the area or organization.


## **Tips for a good [Purpose](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis)**


The [Purpose](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) describes what a [Role](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) seeks to achieve, usually an unattainable or inexhaustible goal. Qualities are important here. You don't need to use a verb, in a [Purpose](https://o2.targetteal.com/meta-acordos/estrutura-organizacional#papeis) the nouns and adjectives are most important:

Here are some examples:



* Analyzes highly accurate and quickly produced.
* Marketing campaigns that delight users and maximize acquisition.
* Clients heard and their wishes fulfilled.


# **Contextual Results**

An organizational structure is obtained in a short time to be used as a starting point. Clarity about expectations begins to appear. Some personal and professional crises may arise from the realization that some people, up to that moment, delivered value by mainly controlling the work of others.


# **Rationale**

This pattern was inspired by the work carried out by Holacracy consultants.


# **Known uses**

It has been used in dozens of organizations in Brazil.
