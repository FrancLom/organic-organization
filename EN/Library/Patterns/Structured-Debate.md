# Structured Debate

**Also known as**: Debate Meeting, Debate Protocol


# **Context**

An organization which uses a social technology like O2, or meeting practises which give space to debates.  

**Problem**

When we have regular structured meetings that deal with various tensions, we gain efficiency and clarity of direction, but there is not much space for the debate of ideas in these regular meetings. Some people value the existence of a safe space to challenge ideas, opinions and perspectives on a key topic or issue.


# **Strengths**

If we try to make room for a debate in a regular or circle meeting, we are limited in time and can't address complex topics or we end up using people's  time who may not be interested in debating a certain topic.


# **Solution**

The person whose tension is to hear different perspectives on a topic or having a debate, invites a session, explaining the topic and the context. Ideally, the topic is defined in the form of a question. For example: "Should we change the name of our company?"

At the beginning of the debate session, those present choose a facilitator. The requester raises the question. A spreadsheet or document is opened. The pros and cons arguments will be recorded in the document.

The facilitator opens for someone (including the applicant) to bring forth:

When it's a new argument, the facilitator asks someone else to paraphrase the argument, checking the understanding with whoever brought the argument. The same person who paraphrased records in the document a synthesis of the argument checking with whoever brought the argument.

The facilitator should observe whether what is put into the debate fits into the categories listed above and point out when it is not. In the debate: "Should we change the name of our company?":

Example of a pro argument: “There is confusion with the name, as it is in English and difficult to pronounce”

Example of an argument against: “We are known by the market and when we change our name, we will lose some of that recognition”

Complement example: “Confusion around a of name is common in client companies, it takes time for a person to understand the word Teal”

Example of an enlightening question: "When you say confusion, do you also believe that this also happens with clients, or is that rare?"

Example of invalid speech: "We are investing very little in social media and that is why people do not know our name." - Invalid because it deviates from the theme and does not fit into the categories above.

Example of invalid speech: "I propose that we use a name in Portuguese to value our language" - Invalid because it tries to turn the debate into deliberation.

Example of invalid speech: "How can you want to change the name, you never seem to be satisfied with anything!" It is not valid because it is a speech that tries to discredit the interlocutor instead of opposing, clarifying or presenting a new argument.

The facilitator repeats the process, often by way of rounds, until the requester is satisfied or the time for the scheduled meeting runs out. The goal is not to reach consensus, just to debate an important topic, making clear the different arguments for and against.


# **Contextual Results**

After a debate, there may be a need for deliberation on the topic. In this case, the organizational structure that already exists can give clarity to who decides or what decision process can or should be used.


# **Rationale**

Research shows that structured spaces for debate are healthier https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01103.pdf. When we enter into an open debate to change our opinion and are able to listen carefully to different arguments, we open the space for the construction of meaning (sensemaking) that is fundamental to organizational life. In addition, when we validate and qualify the existence of debates in the organization, we create a more fluid environment for new ideas.


# **Known Uses**

It has been used in Target Teal and EduK.


# **Related Patterns**

There are established online spaces for asynchronous debate such as https://www.kialo.com/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/ that can serve as a tool for similar contexts.
