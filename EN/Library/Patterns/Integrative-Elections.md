# Integrative Elections

**Also known as**: Integrative Election Process

# **Context**

A Circle that needs to hold elections for people to energize roles among a small set of alternatives.

**Strengths**

The human tendency to seek group acceptance and compliance is evident. We cannot escape it entirely, but we can design a selection process that reduces these biases to a minimum. When people simply repeat the other's opinion, without reflecting responsibly on their choice, an implicit relationship of dominance is established. The most extroverted and with the greatest rhetoric stand out. This is often not a conscious process, which further aggravates the problem.

The main strength of this pattern is the quick selection of people for certain roles, while preventing the group from being too hastily influenced. The integrative elections encourages the participant to take responsibility for their vote and avoid politicking and exchange of favors, as they do not have an explicit candidacy.

**Problem**

The O2 Meta-Agreements expect Circle Members to be selected for the Facilitator, Secretary and Internal Link Roles. This standard presents a simple and direct way to elect any Member of the Circle (present or not at that moment), avoiding as much as possible the bias described in the previous section.


# **Solution**

In [Circle Meeting] during the Synchronize Mode, the facilitator or secretary can conduct an election for Facilitator, Secretary and / or Internal link Roles, by using the following steps. For each election, repeat:



1. **Present Role**: The Facilitator describes the Role that will be elected (name, purpose, responsibilities and artifacts) and specifies the duration of this election (usually 3, 6 or 12 months). Reading the role description and providing space for questions about Role is usually enough. The Facilitator may also remind everyone who the eligible persons are (the members of the Circle, considering the restrictions defined in the Meta-Agreements.
2. **Initial Voting Round**: Participants who are members of the Circle register their vote on a ballot. This can be done by describing it as follows: I, (my name), name (name of person) for the Role of X. You are not allowed to vote for multiple people or abstain, but it is possible to vote for yourself if you are eligible. The restrictions of meta-agreements must be respected (for example, the person who energizes the Role of External Link in the Circle cannot be elected as Facilitator facilitator of the same the Circle. The initial vote is secret and nominations can only be revealed after everyone has voted (in the next step).
3. **Initial Explanation.** In a round, each participant explains the reason for their vote, without mentioning other participants besides the one voted. This process ensures that the person will be responsible for their choice, in addition to preventing them from failing to deal with the waiver of not having voted for someone else.
4. **Final Vote:** After hearing all the explanations, each participant repeats the vote, filling out the ballot again. You are allowed to keep the vote or switch to someone else, if you have been convinced of any other argument.
5. **Final Explanation:** Each participant who changed their vote explains why, without mentioning other participants besides the one voted.
6. **Proposal**: The Facilitator counts the votes and makes a proposal for the election of the most voted participant, specifying the duration. For example: Based on the majority of votes, I propose the election of Gabriel to the Role of Facilitator for the next 3 months, or until someone asks for a new election. If there is a tie, the Facilitator must use the tiebreaker criteria described in the Meta-Agreements.
7. **Objection Round**: One at a time, the Facilitator asks the participating member of the Circle if he or she sees any harm (an objection) in relation to the proposal made, leaving the person being proposed last. If any participant raises an Objection, it can be tested using the same criteria as the Objection of proposals in Adapt Mode, or discarded by Facilitator. More details in the next section on possible Objections.
8. **Integration Round**: If there are Valid Objections, they can be integrated into the proposal.


## **Some possible objections**

Objections in an election process are rare, but possible. The most common is the one raised by the Circulo member who was elected, stating that he does not want to energize the Role. In this case, it is acceptable for the current Facilitator to discard the proposal and repeat the election without that candidate.

Another common case is that the participant claims that he is willing to do the Role, but does not have the necessary skills to perform it. In that case the Facilitator can remind you that he can try the new Role, and if that tension manifests, he can ask for a new election.

An objection that can be dismissed and disregarded in the Integrative Election is one that questions the election process itself. For example, in a given group, a participant can say that he has an objection and state: that Gabriel who was elected does not represent me. This type of objection must be dismissed, because it disqualifies the Meta-Agreements themselves, which use Elections to energize Facilitator, Secretary and Internal Link Roles. If this happens, the Facilitator should also consider using the Caring Mode, to address this tension brought on by the participant who raised the objection, which has a tribal character (it is a tension between people).


# **Contextual Results**

After practicing the Integrative Elections pattern, it is common for participants to be surprised by the results. People who would never have been considered for energizing any of the eligible Roles - because they do not declare themselves candidates - end up being elected and developing new skills. In some cases, participants also tend to experience some discomfort when it comes to choosing only one person to vote, without justifying why they did not vote for another. Despite being challenging, it is an opportunity for growth in terms of self-responsibility and also a way to preserve the organizational space.

**Rationale \
**This pattern is present in Holacracia and constitutes the standard and definitive way to carry out the Elections for the Facilitator, Secretary and Representative Link (the internal link in O2) Roles.


# **Known uses**

This pattern has already been used in virtually all organizations that practice or have practiced Holacracia.
