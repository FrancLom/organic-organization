# Powerful Questions


# **Context**

A Circle that is starting to practice the O2 Synchronize Mode and that still has habits related to the old power structure, whether it is looking for group approval (consensus) or from the former boss.


# **Strengths**

Some Anti-Patterns tend to manifest themselves while doing the Synchronize Mode, byway of  habits already acquired or an organizational culture incompatible with self-responsibility. "Everything is for Everyone" leads individuals to transfer their responsibility to the group, which is an abstract entity and unable to take action. The search for consensus or appreciation of everyone before taking action can be so frequent that it leads to an exponential increase in the List of Tensions and therefore makes the Circle meeting the only space to solve problems, even in a dysfunctional way.

Another Anti-Pattern involves personalization, that is, requests are addressed to people, and not to the Roles present in the Circle. This increases the frequency of Heroic Acts (when participants act outside their Roles or break Meta-Agreements) and makes the Circle blind to the Organizational Structure, leading everyone to an unconsciousness of the established agreements.

Finally, the Antipattern "Perfect is never done" (not yet described) may also be present, where the group is unable to take the next step and instead gets stuck in endless discussion.


# **Problem**

We need an effective Synchronize Mode, enabling people to reflect on their habits and invoke the defined Organizational Structure. We need to stop attributing everything to everyone and take responsibility for our perceptions and Tensions.


# **Solution**

During Synchronize Mode, the Facilitator can use one or more of the "Powerful Questions" to reveal any Antipattern at play or help the participant who is handling their Tension find a way to do so.

To begin each item on the Tension List, the Facilitator may ask:



* A. What is your tension? What do you need?

Both questions focus on who is bringing Tension, seeking to make the person responsible and also reducing the chance of the participant manifesting the "Everything is for everyone" Anti-Pattern. The questions also invite the participant to express their individual needs and focus their perspective on what they see or perceive.

When the discussion reaches a point where it appears that the participants are trying to find a perfect solution to the tension, perhaps the group is expressing the "Perfect that is never done" Anti-Pattern. In this case, two questions can be valuable:



* B. What is the next step? What is the simplest project or action that can help you move forward?

These questions show the participant who brought the Tension that it is not necessary to seek a perfect solution to the problem in question. What matters is to take a next step. Some participants believe that the Circle meeting is the only "official" moment of interaction between the members of the Circle, and so they end up wanting to discuss everything at that moment. This Anti-Pattern can be intensified by "Everything is for Everyone", when in addition to seeking a perfect solution, individuals still need it to be approved or appreciated by the group.

To reveal the current structure and show the participants that what matters are the roles, circles and restrictions already defined, the Facilitator can use:

C. Which role has the authority to decide this? Is there a role that takes care of that today?

D. Is there an Artifact or Restriction that prevents its action?

E. Are you waiting for someone to do this?

The focus in this case is to help the participant make a clear request. The first step is to check what the structure says about the order being placed. If there is already a Role that takes care of that, just send the request to that Role. If the Role is from another Circle, the Inner Link can help. If there is no Role, the Facilitator can help the participant ask for a heroic act or else propose a responsibility or a new Role in the adapt mode.

If everything indicates that it is the participant himself who has a responsible Role, the Facilitator can check what he or she wants to do:

F. Given that you have the authority to do this, what do you need?

G. Would you like to consult or listen to people's opinions?

These two final questions prevent the participant from transferring his responsibility to others. Even with the responsibility to do something, anyone can ask for help or advice. But this must be made explicit, to avoid that there is a projection of his or her dissatisfaction in the group.

In asking all these questions, the Facilitator should seek to accommodate the Tension and the needs of the participant in question. It is important not to disqualify his or her perception, or worse, to discard the tension brought on by considering it "inadequate". There are no inadequate tensions, only more or less effective strategies for dealing with them within O2.


## **Triggers**

Some triggers can be useful for the Facilitator to notice when the group demands the use of one or another powerful question. But beware! It's not a piece of cake. Always analyze the context.

Powerful Questions:

A. What is your tension? What do you need?

B. What is the next step?

C. Who has the authority to decide this?

D. Is there an Artifact or Restriction that prevents this action?

E. Are you waiting for someone to do this? Do you expect something from someone?

F. Given that you have the authority to do this, what do you need?

G. Would you like to consult or listen to people's opinions?

**Contextual Results  \
**Using "Powerful Questions", Circles tend to become more aware of their agreements and habits. Referencing the Organizational Structure constantly also leads to the refinement of Roles, Circles and Restrictions, and has the potential to reduce the number of Heroic Acts. The shadow of the previous power structure decreases as the new agreements are strengthened.


# **Rationale**

Some of these questions are derived from the Holacracia "Tactical Meeting" practice. Others - like the one that questions the next step - are highly influenced by David Allen's Getting Things Done method.


# **Known Uses **

This pattern is practised in almost all organizations that have started their journey using Organic Organization.
