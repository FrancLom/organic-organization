# Preface

**Organic Organization (O2)** is a catalyst that helps organizations and their subparts (teams, departments, units) embrace self-management. O2 is composed of its **Rule Book** and an ever growing [Pattern Library](https://targetteal.com/o2/library/).

Anyone who agrees to take part of an **Organic Organization** may rely on the rules here presented and also agrees to be bound by its duties and constraints.

# Organizational Structure

**Organic Organizations** have an organizational structure composed of roles, circles, and restrictions, which define expectations and limitations of authority. Those elements form a hierarchy of circles, and are described in details in the upcoming section. The Organizational Structure of a circle can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of its circle meeting.  

## Roles

Members of the organization will typically perform work for the organization in one or more explicitly defined roles.

A role is a part of the organization composed of:
- A descriptive name (mandatory);
- A purpose, which is the never ending goal of the role (mandatory);
- Accountabilities, which are recurring activities that others can expect the role will perform (optional);
- Artifacts, which are things that the role can exclusively control and regulate for the organization (optional).

## Circles

Circles are analogous structures to roles, and thus have the same properties described in the role section.

Circles can contain roles and inner circles, that can contain their own roles and inner circles, and so on. The structure is fractal. From the perspective of an outer circle, its inner circles are like roles that have the additional ability to break themselves down.

Circles are composed of roles and inner circles, not people. You are a member of the circle if you fill a role in that same circle.

Inner circle properties (name, purpose, accountabilities, and artifacts) can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of its outer circle meeting.

A circle artifact can be accessed by all circle members, except if it has been delegated to a specific role in that circle.

The organization itself is the broadest circle in the structure, containing all other ones.

Inner circles are created for the purpose of maintaining the circle meetings with a manageable number of people and clear focus.  

## Restrictions

Restrictions are limitations of authority that apply to all roles of a given circle.

Restrictions are composed of a title and a description (both mandatory).

Restrictions cascade to all inner circles, unless otherwise specified in the description.

Restrictions cannot set expectations, because that is the goal of an accountability (property of a role or circle). Nevertheless, a restriction may demand action, but only for the person(s) or role(s) to which the restriction applies in the specific condition that triggers it.

Restrictions can only be adopted inside circle meetings, more specifically in the _Adapt Mode_.

# Rights

When taking part of an **Organic Organization**, circle members have two basic rights.

## No implicit expectations

You may deny requests to take specific projects and actions if no matching explicit accountability is captured in the requested role's description. However, you should always accept projects and actions if you think they fit your role's purpose, even if no explicit accountability is recorded.

## Everything is allowed by default

When pursuing your role's purpose, you are always allowed to take action, unless an explicit artifact or circle restriction says otherwise.

# Duties

When taking part of an **Organic Organization**, circle members have some basic duties towards one another.

## Expressing roles

You are responsible for monitoring how your role's purpose and accountabilities are expressed, and comparing that to your vision of their ideal potential expression. You should identify those gaps between the current reality and a potential you sense, each one being a tension.

You are also responsible for trying to resolve those tensions by using the authorities and other mechanisms available to you under the Rule Book.

## Transparency

When requested, you are expected to share all relevant information about your roles' work, including each project you are working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics.

Upon request, you are also expected to give estimates and projections about possible completion dates of projects and actions, even though those projections shall not be considered deadlines or commitments.

## Prioritization

You are expected to prioritize your work in alignment with circle priorities defined by the Outer Link, or any other process that sets priorities.

## Circle Meetings

When requested by other circle members, you should prioritize attending to the circle meetings over working on your roles' project and actions.

# Circle Meetings

Circle members regularly gather in a space called circle meeting in order to perform one or more of the 5 special modes described in the upcoming sections: _Review_, _Sync_, _Adapt_, _Select_, and _Care_.

Circle members can invite people that are not members of the circle to solve particular issues or process tensions.

Circle meetings are scheduled by the circle's Secretary and facilitated by the Facilitator, two special roles described in the core roles section.

## Meeting format

Circle meetings start with a check in round and end with a check out round. The Facilitator fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 different modes, according to the time available and the needs of the circle.

In the check in round, one at a time, each participant shares how he or she is coming to the meeting.

In the check out round, one at a time, each participant shares a closing reflection about the meeting.

The Facilitator should not allow any discussion or crosstalk in both rounds, in order to preserve the individual space of every circle member.

The different modes should never be mixed together. The Facilitator must state the name, goal, and clarify rules of each mode before beginning to facilitate each one.

## Review Mode

The goal of the _Review Mode_ is to give transparency about the circle's work. That is usually accomplished by reviewing metrics, recurring actions, and projects.

It's up to the Facilitator to decide how specifically the _Review Mode_ is conducted, except if a restriction determines otherwise.

Detailed suggestions can be found in the **Pattern Library**.

## Sync Mode

The goal of the _Sync Mode_ is to quickly process tensions into actions, projects, information requests and information sharing.

The Facilitator starts by asking the Secretary to build a list of tensions to process. Each person feeling a tension must label it using two or three words aloud. The Secretary then records the label, along with the name of the participant.

The Facilitator must not give any more space to allow the person to explain the tension during the process of building the list.

After the tension list is built, the Facilitator must go through the list and process one tension at a time, trying to help the item owner to get what he or she needs.

The Facilitator must simply allow the list item owner to engage others in their roles and duties as desired, until a path for resolving the tension is identified.

The Facilitator must attempt to allow time for processing every tension list item within the _Sync Mode_, and in order to do so may cut off the processing of any item thatâ€™s taking more than its due share of the remaining time.

The Secretary then records any requested projects and actions accepted by the participants.

The _Sync Mode_ structure can be changed entirely with a restriction, provided that the goal is maintained.

## Adapt Mode

The goal of the _Adapt Mode_ is to process tensions into structural changes in the circle. These changes include:

- Adding, removing or changing circle roles;
- Adding, removing or changing inner circles;
- Adding, removing or changing circle restrictions;

What can be done in the _Adapt Mode_ can only be done inside the _Adapt Mode_. This means that you cannot add, remove or change the circle structure outside this mode. Except for asynchronous proposals.

The Facilitator must ask the Secretary to build a list of tensions to process, exactly as described in the _Sync Mode_.

After the tension list is built, the Facilitator must guide the resolution of each tension list item, using the following process guidelines:

- Quick proposal building
- One tension at a time
- Example-based proposals only
- Structural changes only
- Personal expression equivalence
- Integrative decision-making

### Quick proposal building

The tension list item owner should be able to present a proposal to solve his or her own tension in the process.

Alternatively, the Facilitator may allow the item owner to ask help from other participants to craft the proposal. If that is the case, the Facilitator should not allow any consensus building process. The goal is to solve the item owner's tension, not to satisfy everyone.

### One tension at a time

The tensions should be processed one at a time. This means that the Facilitator should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives and/or tensions in the current proposal, unless the item owner deems those perspectives are useful to solve his or her own tension.

### Example-based proposals only

The item owner must explain the tension and give an example about a past or present situation where each part of the crafted proposal would solve or reduce the tension. That is mandatory.

If the Facilitator deems that the item owner has failed to present the required example and explanations, the Facilitator must discard the proposal. Nevertheless, the Facilitator should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

### Structural changes only

To be a valid output for the _Adapt Mode_, the proposal should be composed only of structural changes. If that is not the case, any participant can raise a Rule Book violation objection.

### Personal expression equivalence

Each participant of the circle should have the same space and the option to ask questions or express his or her opinion during the execution of the _Adapt Mode_. How exactly this space is made available is up to the Facilitator.

### Integrative decision-making

The Facilitator must use an integrative decision-making process to facilitate the resolution of each tension. That means that any participant must be allowed to raise one or more objections to the proposal.

If no objections are raised, the proposal is accepted.

If there are objections, they must be integrated to the proposal.

#### Objections

An objection is a reason why the proposal would cause harm to the circle and move it backwards. The Facilitator can ask questions to help the objector understand if his or her objection is valid. These questions must evaluate:

1. **Degradation**. The objection is about some harm that the proposal would cause to the circle. This harm must be explained.
2. **Causality**. The objection must be caused by the proposal in order to be valid.
3. **Data-based**. The objection is based on current data or past experience. In other words, it's not an anticipation of future events. However, if the claimed harm is so disastrous that the circle would not be able to adapt in the future, then the objection can be predictive and this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The objection affects one of the objector roles in the circle.

When validating objections, the Facilitator should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid objections are moved to integration.

#### Rule Book violation objection

Any participant can raise a "Rule Book violation objection" if he or she deems the proposal violates one of the rules described in this Rule Book. For example, one might say that a proposal is not a valid output for the _Adapt Mode_.

In this case, the Facilitator can ask the Secretary to decide whether this is true or not. This special objection does not need to be validated using the criteria described in this section. Rule Book violation objections must be integrated normally.

### Integration

After harvesting valid objections, the Facilitator must guide their integration to the proposal. One objection should be integrated at a time. The goal is to craft an amended proposal that would solve the original tension without causing the objection.

If the proposal is amended, the Facilitator must give another opportunity to the participants to raise objections.

If a proposal is taking too much time to integrate, the Facilitator can discard the proposal entirely in order to move to the next tension list item.

### Asynchronous Proposals

Structural changes can be proposed outside circle meetings and are automatically adopted if all circle members declare that they don't have any objections. If any objections are raised, the proposal must be escalated to the _Adapt Mode_ of a circle meeting.

It's up to the Secretary to define how this process is accomplished.

## Select Mode

The goal of the _Select Mode_ is to select circle members to fill the three structural roles: facilitador, Secretary and Inner Link.

Anyone in the circle can ask for the Facilitator to jump to the _Select Mode_ and perform an election for one of the three elected roles. If that is the case, this should be done immediately.

The process of electing the three structural roles must be done only inside a circle meeting.

The Facilitator must facilitate an election process, considering the following rules:

- Every member of the circle is eligible for all three roles, with the exception of the person who fills the External Link mode, which is not eligible as Facilitator or Inner Link.
- If there is a tie, the Facilitator can chose one of the following criteria to untie:
  - The person who named him or herself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
  - The person who is already filling the role, if only one of the tied candidates is;
  - Random;
- The person who fills the External Link role cannot be elected as Facilitator or Inner Link of the same circle.
- Only circle members are eligible as Facilitator, Secretary or Inner Link.

For examples of election processes for the _Select Mode_, see the **Pattern Library**.

The structure of the _Select Mode_ can be restricted using a restriction, provided that the goal is maintained and the rules above are followed.

## Care Mode

The goal of this mode is to care for the tribal space, and nurture the quality of relationships between circle members. The format is open for the Facilitator to decide how to use.

This space should not be used to make changes to the structure of the circle or ask projects and actions from other circle members.

# Core Roles

Every circle has 4 core roles automatically created: External Link, Inner Link, Facilitator, and Secretary.

The Facilitator and the Secretary are elected in the _Select Mode_ and operate mainly inside circle meetings.

The External Link and Inner Link are used to exchange messages and facilitate communication between circle and external circle, specially during circle meetings.

## Outer Link

The Outer Link is chosen by the external circle, by whatever process that assigns people to roles in the external circle.

The Outer Link is accountable for assigning people to roles in the circle, and may invite any person that is part of the organization, unless a restriction says otherwise.

The Outer Link can also establish priorities for the circle, and circle members are expected to align with those priorities.

The Outer Link role can be excluded or modified entirely with a restriction.

The Outer Link holds all circle un-delegated artifacts and accountabilities.
